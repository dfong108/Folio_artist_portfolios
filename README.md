# Folio_artist_portfolios
This is a full stack Django / React application to be submitted as Project 4 at General Assembly. Folio is a platform where various types of artists can create a portfolio, offer their services and interact with their subscribers. Subscribers, on the other hand, can follow artists, share and interact with their art.
